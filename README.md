IntuitiveInventory is a user-friendly inventory management application designed to help small businesses and individuals track their stock levels efficiently. The app provides real-time monitoring of inventory items with automated alerts when stock levels fall below specified thresholds. This solution addresses the common challenges faced by small business owners in managing their inventory effectively. Many businesses struggle with manual inventory tracking, leading to stockouts or overstock situations. IntuitiveInventory solves this by providing automated tracking and alerts, enabling users to maintain optimal stock levels without constant manual monitoring.

The application implements a carefully designed three-screen architecture that prioritizes user experience and efficiency. The login and authentication screen provides secure access with user registration and login functionality. The main inventory grid displays items in an intuitive layout with color-coded stock levels, while the item management dialog enables adding and editing inventory items with threshold settings. The user interface was designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, utilizing a consistent black and gold color scheme that provides aesthetic appeal and functional contrast. Each screen was designed to minimize user actions while maximizing information visibility, with the grid layout allowing users to quickly scan their inventory status through color-coded indicators showing items below threshold.

The development process followed a modular approach by separating concerns between user interface, data management, and business logic. The application uses SQLite for data persistence including a simple database structure for user authentication and inventory management. Android's Material Design components were utilized to ensure a consistent and modern user experience. The technical implementation includes SQLite database for data persistence, runtime permissions handling for SMS functionality, custom adapters for RecyclerView implementation, and Shared Preferences for user session management.

Testing was conducted throughout the development process using Android Studio's built-in emulator across multiple device configurations. Each feature was tested individually and as part of the integrated system. Additionally, attention was paid to database operations and data persistence, user authentication flows, SMS and notification functionality, and UI responsiveness and state management. The testing process revealed several edge cases that required additional error handling, particularly around permission management and data validation. These were addressed through iterative improvements to the codebase.

A significant development challenge was implementing the SMS notification system while maintaining app functionality when permissions were denied. This was solved by creating a fallback notification system using Android's notification channels, ensuring users always receive alerts, whether through SMS or system notifications. The inventory grid implementation showcases advanced Android development concepts, including a custom RecyclerView adapter with efficient view recycling, real-time updates to UI based on database changes, smooth animations for item additions and removals, and integrated Material Design components for consistent styling.
The application requires Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher and utilizes several key libraries including AndroidX Core KTX, Material Design Components, SQLite Database, and Android Notification Manager. Future enhancements planned for the application include data backup and restore functionality, advanced analytics and reporting, barcode scanning integration, and multiple user roles and permissions. The combination of thoughtful design, considerate implementation, and thorough testing has resulted in a reliable and user-friendly inventory management solution that effectively meets the needs of small business owners and individual users alike.
